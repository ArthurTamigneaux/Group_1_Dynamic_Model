## Task 1: 

The model describes the evolution of the populations of plants, hares and lynx depending on several parameters. When determining the parameters, the curves in the graph change which leads to interactions between each species. Each species are thus interdependant. 

The parameters are: 

a1 : Growth rate of hares due to the availability of plants.

b1 : Effect of predation on hares by lynx.

d1 : Death rate of hares from natural causes or predation.

a2 : Growth rate of lynx due to the availability of hares. 

b2 : Effect of competition among lynx for hares.

d2 : Death rate of lynx from natural causes or lack of prey.

Plant=y(1); hares=y(2); lynx=y(3).

## Task 2: 

### Scenario 1

We have changed 2 parameters: (1) the initial condition for the number lynx and (2) the parameter b2 (the effect of the competition among the lynx for hares). When setting the parameters respectively on 8.3 and 1.1 (other parameters remain unchanged), we obtain a graph with each curve having a periodicity of approximately 70 months.

### Scenario 2

In the second scenario, 6 parameters were changed: (1)(2)(3) the initial conditions for every population, (4) the parameter b1 to 0.1, (5) the parameter d1 to 0.88, and (6) d2 to 0.5. In the graph, the population of lynx goes extinct after around 12 months and the relation between hares and plants stabilizes around 120 months.

### Scenario 3

Only the values of the initial population of the plants and the hare were changed. We can define the model as chaos. 
Firstly, it is deterministic since it keeps a similar pattern over the months even if it is not regular. 
Secondly, the state space is bounded and doesn't go to infinity. 
Lastly, it is irregular since it does not periodically repeat itself.
